// Add public member functions to your class to overload the following operators:

// • The 6 comparison operators: >, <, >=, <=, == and !=.
// • The 4 arithmetic operators: +, -, *, and /.
// • The 4 increment/decrement (pre-increment and post-increment, pre-decrement and
// post-decrement) operators, that will increase or decrease the fixed-point value from

// the smallest representable ϵ such as 1 + ϵ > 1.
// Add these four public overloaded member functions to your class:

// • A static member function min that takes as parameters two references on fixed-point
// numbers, and returns a reference to the smallest one.

// • A static member function min that takes as parameters two references to constant
// fixed-point numbers, and returns a reference to the smallest one.

// • A static member function max that takes as parameters two references on fixed-point
// numbers, and returns a reference to the greatest one.

// • A static member function max that takes as parameters two references to constant
// fixed-point numbers, and returns a reference to the greatest one.
