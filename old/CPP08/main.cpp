// Develop a Span class that can store a maximum of N integers.
//  N is an unsigned int
// variable and will be the only parameter passed to the constructor.
// This class will have a member function called addNumber() 
// to add a single number
// to the Span. It will be used in order to fill it.
//  Any attempt to add a new element if there
// are already N elements stored should throw an exception.
// Next, implement two member functions: shortestSpan() and longestSpan()
// They will respectively find out the shortest span or the longest span (or distance, if
// you prefer) between all the numbers stored, and return it. If there are no numbers stored,
// or only one, no span can be found. Thus, throw an exception.
// Of course, you will write your own tests and they will be way more thorough than the
// ones below. Test your Span at least with a minimum of 10 000 numbers. More would be
// even better.
